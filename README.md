# Practical-Understanding-of-DFT
This is a latex version of my reading notes on Density Functional Theory
over last four years. I've been trying a bunch of different techniques to produce new research. 
Among these techniques that are self-taught, 
DFT seems to be a numerical method that is fairly easy to internalize conceptually. 
The notes here are made when I was reading the following resources:

[4] DFT+U calculations and several approaches to determining the parameter (Uâ€“J) are
described in the study by Da Silva et al. cited above and also by N. J. Mosey and E. A.
